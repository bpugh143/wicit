    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>WIC offers lots of programs and services to help keep California healthy.
        From educational materials, to programs that help participants shop at local farmers'
        markets, WIC can help make sure you and your kids get the nutrition you need.</p><h4>
        Farmers' markets</h4>
    <p>WIC offers two programs to help you buy fruits and vegetables at your local farmers'
        market.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h5>Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP)</h5>
            <p>The Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) is funded by the U.S. Department of
                Agriculture (USDA) to provide fresh, nutritious, locally grown fruits and vegetables
                from farmers' markets to WIC families and seniors. Each eligible WIC family or
                senior receives $20 in checks each season to purchase fresh fruits, vegetables, and
                cut herbs from a WIC authorized farmer at WIC authorized market in California.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h5>WIC Fruit & Vegetable Checks (FVC)</h5>
            <p>In October 2009, fruit and vegetables were added to the WIC food package for
                participants to purchase at authorized grocery stores. In May 2010 the first
                farmers' market was authorized to accept WIC fruit and vegetable checks. Since 2010,
                over 200 farmers and 35 markets have been authorized to accept the fruit and
                vegetable checks. For the list of authorized farmers and markets please see&nbsp;<a
